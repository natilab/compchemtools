# compchemtools

Tools for automation of computational chemistry tasks and routines.

A set of modular python scripts that can be used via command line to automate:
* Processing conformational searches performed in Hyperchem.
* Creation of Gaussian 09 inputs from conformational searches or molecular geometries.
* Processing outputs of Gaussian 09 calculations (single point, optimization and frequency jobs).
* Writing xyz coordinates of optimized geometries for publication in scientific journals.
